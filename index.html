        <!-- A short biography -->
        <p>I worked in the power industry as a contractor for many years. I've had
          the opportunity to work with and for some great people over a span of a
          decade. Each transition that I faced was a move into a more challenging position.
          I've learned and contributed a lot to provide the best services to customers
          as well as employers. It was not too long prior to writing this that I
          decided to pursue my passion for technology and programming. As you can
          imagine having worked in an a particular industry for so long, it was a scary
          as well as an exciting decision. I look forward to what is to come...
